## Usage Limits and Best Practices
  TMDb enforces rate limiting to ensure fair usage of its resources.

Rate Limiting: The API allows up to 40 requests every 10 seconds per IP address.
Best Practices:

Use appropriate timeouts and retries to handle transient errors.
Regularly check for updates to the API and adjust your implementation accordingly.
